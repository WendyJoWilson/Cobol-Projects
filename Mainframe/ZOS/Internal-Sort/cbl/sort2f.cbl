      * Program name:    SORT2F
      * Original author: dastagg
      *
      *    Overview: This is a series of simple examples demonstrating
      *       COBOL Internal Sorting.
      *
      *    List:
      *        SORT1F: Just USING and GIVING
      *        SORT2F: Input Procedure and GIVING
      *        SORT3F: USING and Output Procedure
      *        SORT4F: Input Procedure and Output Procedure.
      *
      *    Description: Program to use COBOL's internal sort 
      *       facility to sort and process datasets.
      *
      *    This version will sort with an Input Procedure and GIVING.
