Because I am working through multiple Tutorials, I will describe the naming conventions I am using here.

As it is my intension to move each program from PC to ZOS to MVS, this will keep the tracking of the source code easier and since I am starting on the PC, it's better to just do this at the beginning.


['Beginning COBOL for Programmers' by Michael Coughlan](http://www.apress.com/9781430262534) :

My Source: BDS0X0Y

Where 0X is the chapter number and 0Y is the exercise number.

For example: Listing8-1.cbl becomes:

BDS0801.cbl


[The Open Mainframe Project](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/coboltrainingcourse) :

My Source : ODSXXXX

Where XXXX is as close as I can match with the original name.

For example: CBL0001.cobol becomes:

ODS0001.cbl


['The Punctilious Programmer' by David E. Woolbright ](https://punctiliousprogrammer.com/ibm-enterprise-cobol/):

My Source: PDS0X0Y

Where 0X is the Unit number and 0Y is the exercise number.

There is one issue with this in that he gives the programs short names already so the names I will be using don't have a direct link to the original source but I will try to follow close to the sequence as presented. I may skip over some programs that are too similar to programs in other tutorials though.


[Enterprise COBOL For Business Application Programming](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/viewdocument/enterprise-cobol-for-business-appli?CommunityKey=b0dae4a8-74eb-44ac-86c7-90f3cd32909a&tab=librarydocuments)

This tutorial is more encompassing than the other tutorials so it makes for a difficult workflow/renaming strategy.

It seems the easiest way forward is to create a new member for each workshop.

My Source: WSXXX

Where XXX is the Workshop number. Workshop 5.2 becomes WS52.cbl.

A lot of the Workshops are modifying existing programs so the new member will just be that but in SCM to be able to restore the code if need be.

The FAV series of programs are created using my prefered structure, naming conventions etc. This includes FAVRPT and FAVRFP.

But, in any case, they will always be identified by the Workshop number.

The assignments and their status will be listed in README4.

Hey, where did the other code go?
It wasn't my code. I didn't have explicit permission to post it so it was removed.
